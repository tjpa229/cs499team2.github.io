# Hello

This is the website for our senior design project. Our project involves
integrating systems such as Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterHub, BinderHub, and cloud
computing resources to create a system that will allow for the creation and
deployment of custom environments that can be executed on UK's resources and
easily shared between users.

## Team members

* TJ Patel (tjpa229@g.uky.edu)

* Jared Payne (jmpa235@g.uky.edu)

## Project requirements

As specified by the project pitch:

> The goal of this project is to construct and deploy a BinderHub system and
> all its components, including working with private and public cloud
> resources, and then tailor it to support one or more specialized
> notebooks. . .The next step is to develop control software that simplifies
> the creation of custom BinderHub environments, along with the development of
> some example environments.

In short, this project can be broken down into two parts.

1. Successfully create a BinderHub environment.

2. Develop a software that can create BinderHub environments.

According to the stakeholders, there is a large amount of flexibility in
how these problems can be approached.

## Project schedule

* 2018/09/17 - Complete project plan, requirements specification, metrics.

* 2018/09/21 - Complete setup of existing technologies on a local computer.

* 2018/08/28 - Complete setup of existing technologies on Google’s cloud
  platform / Kubernetes cluster.

* TBD - Port system to UK’s high-powered computing cluster.

## Project activity

* 2018/09/23 - Finished setup of a BinderHub environment with Google Cloud.

* 2018/09/21 - Met with stakeholders to discuss problems with BinderHub and its
lack of documentation, particularly with its setup.

* 2018/09/05 - Met with stakeholders for requirements elicitation.
